**WaLSAtools** is an open-source library for advanced wave analysis in time series and imaging data, applicable to a wide range of disciplines, including, but not limited to, astrophysics, physics, engineering, environmental science, and biomedical research. It provides a diverse set of tools for analyzing oscillatory signals in one-dimensional and multi-dimensional datasets.

The package, currently available in both Python and IDL, is designed to ensure reliability, reproducibility, and transparency in wave analysis, offering researchers robust methods for extracting meaningful insights from complex datasets.

This repository is referenced in an article in [**Nature Reviews Methods Primers**](https://www.nature.com/nrmp/) (in press), where it is described and applied to synthetic datasets as a foundational toolkit for wave analysis.

## **Installation**

Refer to the `README.md` files in the respective `python` and `idl` directories for installation instructions specific to each language. Further details are provided in the [Online Documentation](https://WaLSA.tools).

For a quick start:
- **Python**: Install using `setup.py` or `pip`.
- **IDL**: Configure using the provided `setup.pro` script.

---

## **Interactive Usage**

WaLSAtools includes an interactive interface to simplify its usage:
- **Python**: Launch the interactive interface by typing `WaLSAtools` in a terminal or Jupyter notebook as
  ```python
    from WaLSAtools import WaLSAtools
    WaLSAtools
  ```
- **IDL**: Start the interface by running the command:
  ```idl
    WaLSAtools
  ```

Both interfaces guide you through:
    1.	Selecting a category of analysis.
	2.	Choosing the data type (e.g., 1D signal, 3D datacube).
	3.	Picking a specific analysis method.

The interface provides hints on calling sequences and parameter definitions for the selected method.
