**WaLSAtools** is an open-source library designed for advanced wave analysis in time series and imaging data. It is applicable across a wide range of disciplines, including astrophysics, physics, engineering, environmental science, and biomedical research, to name but a few. The library provides a diverse suite of tools for analysing oscillatory signals in both one-dimensional and multi-dimensional datasets.

Originally initiated by the [WaLSA Team](https://WaLSA.team) â€” an international consortium of experts in wave analysis in the lower solar atmosphere â€” WaLSAtools was inspired by the complex (magnetohydrodynamic) wave phenomena driven by diverse restoring forces and interacting within one of the most intricate and dynamic systems known: the solar atmosphere. Despite these origins, WaLSAtools has broad applications, making it a versatile toolkit for researchers across a variety of fields.

Currently available in both Python and IDL, WaLSAtools is built to promote reliability, reproducibility, and transparency in wave analysis. Its robust methods enable researchers to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets, ensuring consistency and trustworthiness in results.

This repository is referenced in a primer article titled *"Wave analysis tools"* in [**Nature Reviews Methods Primers**](https://www.nature.com/nrmp/) (NRMP; in press), where its capabilities are showcased using synthetic datasets. The `Worked_examples__NRMP` directories under `examples` (for both Python and IDL) contains reproducible codes for generating the figures featured in the NRMP article and serves as a practical guide for applying WaLSAtools to real-world analyses.

## **Installation**

Refer to the `README.md` files in the respective `python` and `idl` directories for installation instructions specific to each language. Further details are provided in the [Online Documentation](https://WaLSA.tools).

For a quick start:
- **Python**: Install using `setup.py` or `pip`.
- **IDL**: Configure using the provided `setup.pro` script.

---

## **Interactive Usage**

WaLSAtools includes an interactive interface to simplify its usage:
- **Python**: Launch the interactive interface by typing `WaLSAtools` in a terminal or Jupyter notebook as
  ```python
  from WaLSAtools import WaLSAtools
  WaLSAtools
  ```
- **IDL**: Start the interface by running the command:
  ```idl
  WaLSAtools
  ```

Both interfaces guide you through:
1.	Selecting a category of analysis.
2.	Choosing the data type (e.g., 1D signal, 3D datacube).
3.	Picking a specific analysis method.

The interface provides hints on calling sequences and parameter definitions for the selected method.
