**WaLSAtools** is an open-source library for analysing a wide variety of wave phenomena in time series data &ndash; including 1D signals, images, and multi-dimensional datasets. It provides tools to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets and is applicable across diverse fields, including astrophysics, engineering, life, physical and environmental sciences, and biomedical studies, among others. The library is continuously expanding with new features and functionalities, ensuring it remains a valuable resource for wave analysis.

The core of WaLSAtools is built upon [Python](https://www.python.org). This ensures accessibility and ease of use for a broad audience. We are actively developing versions in other popular languages to further enhance accessibility, enabling researchers from various backgrounds to leverage the power of WaLSAtools for their wave analysis needs. Currently, WaLSAtools is partially implemented in IDL, with plans to expand its functionality and extend to other programming languages in the future.

WaLSAtools provides a suite of both fundamental and advanced tools, but it remains the user's responsibility to choose the method that best fits the nature of their dataset and the scientific questions being addressed. Selecting the appropriate analysis method is essential for ensuring reliable and scientifically valid results. The use of unsuitable or overly simplified techniques &ndash; without consideration of the data's properties or the research goals &ndash; can lead to incomplete or incorrect conclusions, and potentially to misinterpretation. This principle is central to our accompanying [Primer](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43586-025-00392-0), which emphasises the importance of methodological awareness in wave analysis across all disciplines.

Developed by the [WaLSA Team](https://WaLSA.team), WaLSAtools was initially inspired by the intricate wave dynamics observed in the Sun's atmosphere. However, its applications extend far beyond solar physics, offering a versatile toolkit for anyone working with oscillatory signals.

WaLSAtools promotes reproducibility and transparency in wave analysis. Its robust implementations of validated techniques ensure consistent and trustworthy results, empowering researchers to delve deeper into the complexities of their data. Through its interactive interface, WaLSAtools guides users through the analysis process, providing the necessary information and tools to perform various types of wave analysis with ease.

This repository is associated with a primer article titled *"Wave analysis tools"* in **[Nature Reviews Methods Primers](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43586-025-00392-0)** (NRMP), showcasing its capabilities through detailed analyses of synthetic datasets. The `examples/Worked_examples__NRMP` directories (for both Python and IDL) contain reproducible codes for generating all figures presented in the NRMP article, serving as a practical guide for applying WaLSAtools to real-world analyses.
