# Acknowledgements

All people who have contributed, in one way or another, to the development of **WaLSAtools**, as well as third‐parties whose codes have been used in the package, are sincerely acknowledged. **WaLSAtools** is a result of scientific discussions with the [**WaLSA team**][1]{target=_blank} which has been supported by the Research Council of Norway (project number 262622), and The Royal Society (grant Hooke18b/SCTM).

While we make every effort to ensure that acknowledgements/credits in this document are complete and accurate, errors may occur. If you see an error or omission, please help us improve this document by sending us an [**email**][2]. 

## Developers/contributors :material-account-group:

Below is a list of individuals who have contributed to **WaLSAtools** (either directly, or by providing their codes used as important part of the package).

  - [Dr Shahin Jafarzadeh][6]{target=_blank} (Leibniz Institute for Solar Physics, Germany)
  - [Dr David B. Jess][7]{target=_blank} (Queen's University Belfast, UK)
  - [Dr Marco Stangalini][8]{target=_blank} (Italian Space Agency, Italy)

## IDL Libraries :material-library:

**WaLSAtools** includes third party components which are part of publicly available libraries (listed below). Most of these dependencies are included in the package, so there is no requirement for pre-installation of these libraries, though it is generally recommended. Only the standard IDL procedures, either the built-in routines or those in the IDL native library (of version 8.5), are not included. [**IDL**][3]{target=_blank} is a registered trademarks of L3Harris Technologies, Inc.

  - [Coyote][4]{target=_blank} (Prof David Fanning)
  - [Daithi][5]{target=_blank} (Dr Dáithí A. Stone)
  - [HeLIx+][12]{target=_blank} (Dr Andreas Lagg)

## Sample Datasets :material-database:

To present examples on the use of **WaLSAtools**, we have included datacubes from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA; [Lemen et al. 2012][14]{target=_blank}) and Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI; [Schou et al. 2012][15]{target=_blank}) instruments on the NASA's Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO; [Pesnell et a. 2012][13]{target=_blank}). The AIA and HMI data (from 26 April 2016, 6:00-8:00 UTC; at around Sun's disc center) are courtesy of the NASA/SDO, as well as AIA and HMI science teams.
