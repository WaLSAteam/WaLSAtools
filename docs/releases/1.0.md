# WaLSAtools 1.0.0

## Release Notes

This is the initial release of WaLSAtools, a comprehensive open-source library for wave analysis. This release provides a foundation for analyzing a wide variety of wave phenomena in time series data, including:

* **Core Analysis Modules:**
    * Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
    * Lomb-Scargle Periodogram
    * Wavelet Transform
    * Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT)
    * Welch's Method
    * k-Ï‰ Analysis
    * Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD)
    * Cross-Correlation Analysis

* **Interactive Interface:** User-friendly interface for easy access to analysis tools and parameters.

* **Worked Examples:** Reproducible examples demonstrating the application of WaLSAtools to synthetic datasets, as presented in the associated *Nature Reviews Methods Primers* article.

* **Documentation:** Comprehensive documentation covering installation, usage, and analysis methods.

* **Multi-Language Support:** Available in Python and IDL, with plans to expand to other languages.

We are excited to share WaLSAtools with the community and look forward to your feedback and contributions.

## Known Issues

* **Limited Feature Parity Between Languages:**  While we strive for full feature parity between the Python and IDL versions, some minor differences may exist in this initial release. We are actively working to address these discrepancies in future updates.

## Future Developments

We are committed to continuously improving and expanding WaLSAtools. Planned future developments include:

* **Enhanced Functionality:**  Adding new analysis methods, improving existing ones, and expanding the capabilities of the interactive interface.
* **Expanded Language Support:**  Developing WaLSAtools in Matlab and potentially other languages to reach a wider audience.
* **Community Engagement:**  Actively seeking feedback and contributions from the community to ensure WaLSAtools remains a valuable and relevant tool for wave analysis.
