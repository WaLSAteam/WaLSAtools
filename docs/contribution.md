# Contribution

The [**WaLSA team**][8]{target=_blank} is committed to facilitating openness, transparency, and reproducibility of its research. We freely share our codes through this open-access repository (on GitHub). The codes are collaboratively developed and advanced over time. Sharing codes not only make them available to other researchers, but can also give us ideas for improvements. 

The initial **WaLSAtools** package we have provided here is just a starting point and our hope is that the community will help us in the journey improving and extending the methods and codes. We also appreciate that Python is becoming a more popular programming language, particularly among younger generations, thus we are grateful for helps with translation of the IDL codes into Python.

Contributions are very welcome and appreciated!

## GitHub :material-github:

**WaLSAtools** utilises [git][10]{target=_blank} as a distributed version control system and is hosted on [GitHub][11]{target=_blank}. For contribution, you would need an account on GitHub to [fork][14]{target=_blank} **WaLSAtools** and submit your changes via a [pull request][15]{target=_blank}, or to, e.g., submit [issues][16]{target=_blank} or questions on our GitHub repository (see below). If you are unfamiliar with GitHub, some useful information/guides can be found [here][12]{target=_blank} and [here][13]{target=_blank}.

## Bug Report :material-bug:

Bugs are tracked in our GitHub's [issue tracker][4]{target=_blank}. Before submitting a [new bug][5]{target=_blank}, please first [read the documentation][2], [check out the troubleshooting][1], and [search][4]{target=_blank} through the issues' database to try and find the answer to your question **before** posting an issue.

When creating an [issue][5]{target=_blank}, please provide as much information as possible:

  - **WaLSAtools** version
  - Version of IDL
  - Operating System and version number
  - Error(s) in terminal
  - Detailed description of the issue
  - Examples for reproducing the error. You may post pictures, but if specific text or code is required to reproduce the issue, please provide it in a plain text format for easy copy/paste.

The more information provided, the greater the chance someone will take the time to answer, implement, or fix the issue. If you are unsure whether or not something is a bug, please ask your question in our [GitHub discussions][3]{target=_blank} instead.

## Feature Request :material-star-shooting:

You can submit your suggestions for additional features, analysis methods, or keywords, under the *wish list* section in our [GitHub discussions][6]{target=_blank}. Please first check whether or not they are already [under development][17].

## Reviewing Codes and Methods :material-glasses:

Quality and reliability of the codes and methods in **WaLSAtools** are our main concern. Take part in reviewing the codes, [pull requests][9]{target=_blank} and direct commits to make suggestions for their improvements and/or discuss solutions to overcome weakness in the methods. General comments and questions should be submitted in [GitHub discussions][3]{target=_blank}.

## Answer Questions :material-comment-question:

Take time and answer questions and offer suggestions to people who have created issues in the [issue tracker][4]{target=_blank} and/or in our [GitHub discussions][3]{target=_blank}. Often people
will have questions that you might have an answer for.  Or maybe you know how to help them accomplish a specific task
they are asking about. Feel free to share your experience to help others out.

## Pull Requests :octicons-git-pull-request-24:

[Pull requests][9]{target=_blank} are welcome, and a great way to help fix bugs and add new features. If you, as an expert, are interested in directly
contributing to the codes, please check out [Development][7] for more information on the environment and process.

## Documentation Improvements :material-pencil:

We strive to provide not only reliable and user-friendly analysis tools, but also helpful documentations and examples. If you feel the documentation can still be improved, your contribution is much appreciated. Check out [Development][7] for more information on the *package layout* and *editing documents*.
