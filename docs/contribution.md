# Contribution

**WaLSAtools** is an open-access and open-source library designed for researchers across diverse fields interested in analyzing oscillatory phenomena. Initially developed and maintained by the [**WaLSA team**][8]{target=_blank}, the project is driven by a commitment to openness, transparency, and reproducibility in research. By sharing this evolving codebase on [GitHub][11]{target=_blank}, we aim to foster collaboration, enabling contributions from a broad community to refine and extend its functionality. We welcome feedback, suggestions, and contributions that help improve WaLSAtools and expand its applications.

The **WaLSAtools** package provided here marks the beginning of an exciting journey. We envision that the broader community will contribute to advancing these tools and methodologies. The core of WaLSAtools is built upon Python, a widely-used programming language in science and engineering, ensuring accessibility and ease of use for a broad audience. To further enhance accessibility, we are actively developing counterparts in other popular languages. Currently, WaLSAtools is also available (partially) in IDL, with plans to expand to additional languages, such as MATLAB, in the future.

Contributions of all kinds are welcome and highly appreciated!
