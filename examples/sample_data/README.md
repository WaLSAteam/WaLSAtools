### WaLSAtools: Sample Data

The sample data, described below, can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/gsqxpvzt5ovotra/AAAiAv6IBvZONit423zi5ro-a?dl=0">this DropBox folder</a>. Before running the example codes, the fits files should be put in the 'sample_data' directory.

* Time series of images from SDO/AIA 1700 nm (two hours observations with a cadence of 12 sec; see the fits header for more information).
* One single SDO/HMI magnetogram corresponding to the middle of the AIA 1700 time series of images.

Other sample datasets, from high-resolution observaitons, will be added at a later point.
