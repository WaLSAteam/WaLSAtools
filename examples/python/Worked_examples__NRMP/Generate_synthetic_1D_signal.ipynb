    "This script generates a synthetic time-series signal by combining various components to model complex,\n",
    "dynamic behaviors often observed in natural systems. The steps involved in the signal generation are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Combining five sinusoidal waves, each with specified frequencies, amplitudes, and phases.\n",
    "2. Introducing a time-varying amplitude for the combined signal to enhance its dynamism,\n",
    "   achieved by modulating the amplitudes of individual waves with an envelope function.\n",
    "3. Applying a nonlinear transformation to the waveform to introduce nonlinearity.\n",
    "4. Adding transient oscillations with specific frequency, amplitude, and duration, \n",
    "   starting at a specified time.\n",
    "5. Incorporating a weak signal component with a specific frequency and amplitude.\n",
    "6. Adding a quasi-periodic perturbation, modulated at a secondary frequency.\n",
    "7. Adding random noise to simulate real-world conditions.\n",
