# Worked Examples: NRMP Synthetic Datasets and Figures

This directory contains example codes and synthetic datasets used to generate the figures featured in the *Nature Reviews Methods Primers* (NRMP) article on **Wave analysis tools**. These examples showcase the application of WaLSAtools (v1.0.0) to controlled synthetic data, providing a practical guide for analysing oscillatory signals.

## Synthetic Datasets

- **1D Time Series**: The synthetic 1D signals are generated with well-defined parameters, including combinations of periodic components, trends, and noise. These signals allow for testing the performance of wave analysis techniques in isolating and characterising oscillatory features under controlled conditions.

- **Spatio-Temporal Datacube**: The synthetic 3D datacube simulates wave phenomena in both space and time. It includes multiple interacting wave modes, background noise, and spatially-varying properties. This dataset serves as a controlled environment for evaluating advanced spatio-temporal analysis techniques.

The synthetic datasets are described in detail in Supplementary Tables S1 and S2 of the NRMP article.

## Reproducing the Figures

The codes provided here correspond to the figures and analyses presented in the NRMP article. For detailed parameter specifications and discussions on the methodologies, please refer to the article. The examples are organised by the figures and can be executed to perform the associated analyses.
