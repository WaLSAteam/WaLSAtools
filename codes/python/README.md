# WaLSAtools: Python Implementation

WaLSAtools is an open-source library designed for advanced wave analysis in time series and imaging data. The Python implementation supports a variety of spectral and spatio-temporal analysis techniques, including:

- **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)**
- **Wavelet Analysis**
- **Lomb-Scargle Periodogram**
- **Welch Power Spectral Density**
- **Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD)**
- **k-omega Analysis**
- **Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD)**
- **Cross-Spectra Analysis**

WaLSAtools provides an interactive interface in both **terminal** and **Jupyter notebooks** for ease of use. For detailed information on installation, methods, and usage examples, please refer to the [WaLSAtools Documentation](https://WaLSA.tools/).
